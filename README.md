# FastAPI City Temperature Management API
With this tool, you can add any city to the database and retrieve temperature data for these cities,
provided the Weather API has such data available.

## Description
This project is a FastAPI application that manages city data and their corresponding temperature records. The project includes:
- A CRUD API to manage city data.
- An API to fetch current temperature data for all cities in the database, as well as historical temperature data.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.10+

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone <your-repository-URL>
   cd py-fastapi-city-temperature-management-api

2. Create a virtual environment and activate it:
   ```sh
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # Linux/macOS
   venv\Scripts\activate  # Windows
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Rename the `.env_sample` file to `.env` and add your own `SECRET_KEY` value:

   ```
   You can get a free SECRET_KEY after signing up at https://www.visualcrossing.com/


## Running the Project

1. Run database migrations using Alembic:
   ```sh
   alembic upgrade head
   ```

2. Start the FastAPI server:
   ```sh
